/home/usr/fll_exec

directory, then do:

mkdir /home/usr/fll_exec
cd /home/usr/fll_exec
/home/usr/fll_souce/master/configure.py -c compiler

where compiler specifies fortran compile options

avalable are:

	gfortran
	gfortran_debug
	x86_64
	x86_64_debug

x86_64 are settings for Intel fortran compiler



NOTE: The configure script should be always located in the
